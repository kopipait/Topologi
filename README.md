This is my attempt to translate [Renzo's Math 490: Introduction to Topology](http://www.math.colostate.edu/~renzo/teaching/Topology10/Notes.pdf), as I feel that it is so difficult to find ebook on this subject in Indonesian. 

My English is fucking so bad, I'm sure there are a lot of mistakes. Any correction is highly appreciated.
